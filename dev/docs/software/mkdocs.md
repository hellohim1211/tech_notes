## Installation

MkDocs can be installed using `pip`, the Python package manager. Follow these steps to install it:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Getting Started

Creating a new MkDocs project is straightforward. Here’s how you can get started:

1. **Create a New Project**:
   ```bash
   mkdocs new my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

   This creates a new directory called `my-project` with the basic structure for an MkDocs project.

2. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

   This starts a local development server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Any changes made to your Markdown files will automatically update in the browser.

3. **Build the Documentation**:
   ```bash
   mkdocs build
   ```

   This generates a static site in the `site/` directory, ready to be deployed.

---

## Configuration

The configuration for MkDocs is managed in the `mkdocs.yml` file. Below is an example configuration:

```yaml
site_name: My Documentation
theme: readthedocs
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - About: about.md
  - Contact: contact.md
```

You can customize the navigation, theme, and other settings to suit your needs.

## Deploying Your Documentation

Once you've built your documentation, you can deploy it to any static hosting service. Here’s an example of deploying to GitHub Pages:

1. Add the following to your `mkdocs.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   site_url: https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/
   ```
2. Use the built-in `gh-deploy` command:
   ```bash
   mkdocs gh-deploy
   ```

This will push the `site/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.
